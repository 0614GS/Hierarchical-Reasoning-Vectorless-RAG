{"node_id": "ef6f30", "title": "Use remote sandboxes", "path": "cli > Deep Agents CLI > Use remote sandboxes", "content": "Execute code in isolated remote environments for safety and flexibility. Remote sandboxes provide the following benefits:\n\n* **Safety**: Protect your local machine from potentially harmful code execution\n* **Clean environments**: Use specific dependencies or OS configurations without local setup\n* **Parallel execution**: Run multiple agents simultaneously in isolated environments\n* **Long-running tasks**: Execute time-intensive operations without blocking your machine\n* **Reproducibility**: Ensure consistent execution environments across teams\n\nTo use a remote sandbox, follow these steps:\n\n1. Configure your sandbox provider ([Runloop](https://www.runloop.ai/), [Daytona](https://www.daytona.io/), or [Modal](https://modal.com/)):\n\n   ```bash  theme={null}\n   # Runloop\n   export RUNLOOP_API_KEY=\"your-key\"\n\n   # Daytona\n   export DAYTONA_API_KEY=\"your-key\"\n\n   # Modal\n   modal setup\n   ```\n\n2. Run the CLI with a sandbox:\n\n   ```bash  theme={null}\n   uvx deepagents-cli --sandbox runloop --sandbox-setup ./setup.sh\n   ```\n\n   The agent runs locally but executes all code operations in the remote sandbox. Optional setup scripts can configure environment variables, clone repositories, and prepare dependencies.\n\n3. (Optional) Create a `setup.sh` file to configure your sandbox environment:\n\n   ```bash  theme={null}\n   #!/bin/bash\n   set -e\n\n   # Clone repository using GitHub token\n   git clone https://x-access-token:${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/username/repo.git $HOME/workspace\n   cd $HOME/workspace\n\n   # Make environment variables persistent\n   cat >> ~/.bashrc <<'EOF'\n   export GITHUB_TOKEN=\"${GITHUB_TOKEN}\"\n   export OPENAI_API_KEY=\"${OPENAI_API_KEY}\"\n   cd $HOME/workspace\n   EOF\n\n   source ~/.bashrc\n   ```\n\n   Store secrets in a local `.env` file for the setup script to access.\n\n<Warning>\n  Sandboxes isolate code execution, but agents remain vulnerable to prompt injection with untrusted inputs. Use human-in-the-loop approval, short-lived secrets, and trusted setup scripts only.\n\n  Note that sandbox APIs are evolving rapidly, and we expect more providers to support proxies that help mitigate prompt injection and secrets management concerns.\n</Warning>\n\n***\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/oss/deepagents/cli.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>\n\n\n---\n\n> To find navigation and other pages in this documentation, fetch the llms.txt file at: https://docs.langchain.com/llms.txt", "summary": "Execute code in remote sandboxes for safety, clean environments, parallel execution, long-running tasks, and reproducibility.
