{"node_id": "5df3ab", "title": "Deep Agents Middleware", "path": "middleware > Deep Agents Middleware", "content": "> Understand the middleware that powers deep agents\n\nDeep agents are built with a modular middleware architecture. Deep agents have access to:\n\n1. A planning tool\n2. A filesystem for storing context and long-term memories\n3. The ability to spawn subagents\n\nEach feature is implemented as separate middleware. When you create a deep agent with `create_deep_agent`, we automatically attach `TodoListMiddleware`, `FilesystemMiddleware`, and `SubAgentMiddleware` to your agent.\n\n```mermaid  theme={null}\ngraph LR\n    Agent[create_deep_agent] --> Todo[TodoList]\n    Agent --> FS[Filesystem]\n    Agent --> Sub[SubAgent]\n\n    Todo --> Tools[Agent Tools]\n    FS --> Tools\n    Sub --> Tools\n```\n\nMiddleware is composable—you can add as many or as few middleware to an agent as needed. You can use any middleware independently.\n\nThe following sections explain what each middleware provides.", "summary": "Introduces the modular middleware architecture for deep agents, including planning, filesystem, and subagent capabilities.", "keywords": ["Deep agents", "Middleware", "TodoListMiddleware", "FilesystemMiddleware", "SubAgentMiddleware", "create_deep_agent", "multi-part tasks", "task delegation", "context isolation"]}
