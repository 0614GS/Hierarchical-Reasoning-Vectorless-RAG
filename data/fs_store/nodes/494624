This keeps the main agent's context clean while still going deep on specific subtasks.\n</Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Long-term memory\" icon=\"database\">\n  Extend agents with persistent memory across threads using LangGraph's Store. Agents can save and retrieve information from previous conversations.\n</Card>", "summary": "Deep agents' core capabilities include planning, context management, subagent spawning, and long-term memory, enabling complex task handling and efficient information processing.", "keywords": ["Planning", "Task Decomposition", "Context Management", "Subagent Spawning", "Long-term Memory", "LangGraph's Store", "write_todos", "task"]}
