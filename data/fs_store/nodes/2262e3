Deep agents support human-in-the-loop workflows through LangGraph's interrupt capabilities. You can configure which tools require approval using the `interrupt_on` parameter.\n\n```mermaid  theme={null}\ngraph LR\n    Agent[Agent] --> Check{Interrupt?}\n    Check --> |no| Execute[Execute]\n    Check --> |yes| Human{Human}\n\n    Human --> |approve| Execute\n    Human --> |edit| Execute\n    Human --> |reject| Cancel[Cancel]\n\n    Execute --> Agent\n    Cancel --> Agent\n```", "summary": "Configure human approval for sensitive operations using LangGraph's interrupt capabilities, covering basic setup, decision types, and handling multiple tool calls.", "keywords": ["human-in-the-loop", "interrupt_on", "configuration", "tool calls", "approve", "edit", "reject", "interrupts", "subagent", "best practices"]}
