Agents maintain context across sessions, learn project conventions, and execute code with approval controls.\n\nThe Deep Agents CLI has the following built-in capabilities:\n\n* <Icon icon=\"file\" size={16} /> **File operations** - read, write, and edit files in your project with tools that enable agents to manage and modify code and documentation.\n* <Icon icon=\"terminal\" size={16} /> **Shell command execution** - execute shell commands to run tests, build projects, manage dependencies, and interact with version control systems.\n* <Icon icon=\"magnifying-glass\" size={16} /> **Web search** - search the web for up-to-date information and documentation (requires Tavily API key).\n* <Icon icon=\"globe\" size={16} /> **HTTP requests** - make HTTP requests to APIs and external services for data fetching and integration tasks.\n* <Icon icon=\"list-check\" size={16} /> **Task planning and tracking** - break down complex tasks into discrete steps and track progress through the built-in todo system.\n* <Icon icon=\"brain\" size={16} /> **Memory storage and retrieval** - store and retrieve information across sessions, enabling agents to remember project conventions and learned patterns.\n* <Icon icon=\"head-side\" size={16} /> **Human-in-the-loop** - require human approval for sensitive tool operations.\n\n<Tip>\n  [Watch the demo video](https://youtu.be/IrnacLa9PJc?si=3yUnPbxnm2yaqVQb) to see how the Deep Agents CLI works.\n</Tip>", "summary": "Interactive CLI for building agents with persistent memory, enabling file operations, shell command execution, web search, HTTP requests, task planning, memory storage, and human approval.", "keywords": ["Deep Agents CLI", "persistent memory", "file operations", "shell command execution", "web search", "HTTP requests", "task planning", "memory storage", "human approval"]}
